# This file contains all items that have appeared in all DnD campaigns on the site.
# This file may also contain items that have not appeared in the story yet.
# If this is the case, the item should have the key "visible" set to false.
# This way it does not appear in any links.

# The following key-value-pairs are available for an item:
# name - string - The name of the item
# visible - boolean - If the item should be visible and navigatable on the site
# customLink - string - optional - A custom link (without extension) for items with names that create invalid links
